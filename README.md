# Web-Scraping---British-Airways-Reviews-Data

task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should use a website called Skytrax.

Analyse data
Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. The data will be very messy and contain purely text. You will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, you should perform your own analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, you could look at topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews.
